# AWS Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) Notes

Hello, I'll be placing here my personal notes while studying for SAA-C03.

I'm currently following the course made by Adrian Cantrill, so the folders would follow how his course curriculum was structured.

To support him, please purchase the course from  [his website](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03).

## Disclaimer 

- All the contents of this repo are solely based on how I personally understood the different topics in Adrian's course. Everything will also be sourced from the said course so there will be no original content coming from my end.

- These are personal notes, structured in a way that makes it easier for "me" to refer to. Given that, it would be more beneficial for other learners to create/maintain their own notes, and just use my notes for comparison purposes for possible missed or incorrect information.

### Happy Learning! :tada:
